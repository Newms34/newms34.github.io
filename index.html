<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction:"></a>Introduction:</h2><p>Recently, I’ve been exploring a lot of biological - and specifically ecological - concepts via coding. As much of ecology is based on the behavior of large systems, it’s a field that naturally lends itself to modeling by computers. Be it evolutionary development, neurology, or just basic ecology, it’s both relatively easy - and rather interesting - to model various systems via something as simple as vanilla JavaScript. Below, I’ll talk about a few of the projects I’ve been playing with recently.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Neural-Network"><a href="#Neural-Network" class="headerlink" title="Neural Network:"></a>Neural Network:</h2><p><a href="davebrain.herokuapp.com">Link</a></p>
<p>According to wikipedia, a neural network is “a computational approach which is based on a large collection of neural units loosely modeling the way a biological brain solves problems with large clusters of biological neurons connected by axons (Wikipedia: Artificial neural network)”.<br>What?<br>Well, put simply, it’s a virtual brain created in a computer. The neurons in the ‘brain’ are, just as in a biological brain, seperate simple subunits, and they’re connected by connections of differing ‘strength’. These differing strengths then determine the path that a particular signal will take through the ‘brain’, much like the neural signal in a real brain.<br>I created a relatively simple neural network simulation in JavaScript and Angular. As with most neural networks, this one needed to have a goal (otherwise, it’ll just sit there and ponder virtual philosophy or something). In this case, the brain attempts to steer a predator organism to catch a prey organism.<br>The neural network also needs to be able to react with its environment. In a biolgoical sense, this’d be like your eyes and ears, and your muscles. The network needs eyes and ears to get its current state, and muscles to adjust its state. In the case of my simulation, I have a pair of distance sensors which simply read the distance to the target, and a set of out ‘states’ that move the organism up, down, left, or right.<br>One interesting facet of this experiment is that, besides the initial goal and input/output of the organism, the initial network is not ‘programmable’. Instead, the network attempts to program itself, obeying the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The network runs until one of five conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network runs out of time. This is essentially starvation, in a biological sense</li>
<li>The network leaves the play area. This is a predator wandering out of its prey area</li>
<li>The network has no active nodes. This constitutes random brain death.</li>
<li>The network has an overwhelming majority of active nodes. This constitutes something like a seizure</li>
<li>The organism successfully catches the prey item.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Each run, the network gets a score, based on two parameters (with lower being better):</p>
<ul>
<li>The final distance to the prey item</li>
<li>The amount of time taken</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>During each run, the paths taken are recorded. At the end of a run, if the current score is better than a moving average, that path is strengthened. If the current score is worse, the path is weakened. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, these relatively simple rules produce a learned behavior. Interestingly, the more nodes you have the better (as would be expected).</p>

<h2 id="Lunar-Lander-Evolution"><a href="#Lunar-Lander-Evolution" class="headerlink" title="Lunar Lander Evolution"></a>Lunar Lander Evolution</h2><p><a href="https://newms34.github.io/Lunar-Lander-Evolution-Sim/" target="_blank" rel="external">Link</a></p>
<p><em>Note: The title of the above page refers to this as a neural network. It’s not!</em></p>
<p>One interesting biological simulation that can be done with code is that of simulated evolution. By giving some sort of ‘survival’ conditions, and a pseudo-randomly mutating spaceship with its own genome, we can produce some basic evolutionary trends.<br>In this example, I’ve created something similar to those ubiquitous lunar lander games that you (used to?) see everywhere: you land on some object with your little spacecraft. This time, however, you have absolutely no control over the spacecraft. Instead, two spacecrafts are generated, each with its own assortment of thrusters, each of which in turn has its own start time, end time, angle, and power settings.<br>Each generation, two spacecraft exist. Except for the initial condition, one of these is an older, ‘parent’ spacecraft, and the other is a mutation off of that parent. The spaceships again have the goal of reaching the target object (the ‘moon’), but this time control is given by an artificial genome that controls the number and stats of each engine.<br>After each generation is complete - i.e., after either one spaceship has landed, one has left the play area, or one has sat with no engines firing for more than 20 seconds - the scores of both spaceships is determined as, again, a combination of distance and time taken. The spaceship with the better score is kept, and the worse-scoring spaceship is discarded. The better spaceship is then duplicated, with a very small chance of mutations. This repeats until the user gets sick of staring at a bunch of circles moving around.<br>Some interesting observations about the behavior of this system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like the Neural Network simulation above, this simulation is not explicitly programmed. That is, while there is ostensibly a success condition (and multiple failure ones!), the spaceship itself doesn’t actually <em>know</em> about this condition. Instead, each generation is rated as an isolated event, and only the emergent behavior of multiple generations leads to any changes.</li>
<li>This, in turn, means that you might observe very little (if any!) progress in the first 30-60 generations or so. This actually makes complete sense, biologically, and is an example of the late Stephen Jay Gould’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium" target="_blank" rel="external">Punctuated Equilibrium</a>, whereby evolution generally occurs very slowly except for the occasional sudden burst of progress. For example, while life is generally agreed to have appeared 3600 million years ago, it took until about 7-800 million years ago (2800 years at least!) for life to figure out that bunching multiple cells together was a good idea. Pretty soon after that, however, we get an enormous number of diverse new evolutionary experiments as part of the Ediacaran fauna and the famous ‘Cambrian Explosion’.</li>
<li>The simulation may reach a plateau, beyond which very little if any improvement occurs. This makes a lot of sense too, as while natural selection is goal-driven - that is, better organisms survive more - evolution itself really isn’t. We might refer to pre-avian dinosauria as trying to ‘figure out’ how to fly, for example, but this is really a combination of a colloquialism and hindsight: We can see that, over time, evolutionary pressures were driving certain organisms towards developing flight. However, neither the birds in this example nor the spaceships in this simulation are individually striving towards any particular goal.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Taxonomy-Database"><a href="#Taxonomy-Database" class="headerlink" title="Taxonomy Database"></a>Taxonomy Database</h2><p><a href="davetaxonomy.herokuapp.com">Link</a></p>
<p>This example is perhaps the simplest of the bunch, and is still somewhat a work-in-progress. It’s basically just a taxonomy database. Current features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a taxon by entering its info in the box.</li>
<li>Remove a taxon by going to davetaxonomy.herokuapp.com/remove/ plus the name of your taxon. So to remove a taxon called ‘myTaxa’, you’d go to davetaxonomy.herokuapp.com/remove/myTaxa. </li>
<li>Draw a tree by picking a taxon and then clicking the ‘draw tree’ button.</li>
<li>Get info on any particular taxon by going to davetaxonomy.herokuapp.com/info/ plus the name of your taxon. Case sensitive. <a href="davetaxonomy.herokuapp.com/info/Bilateria">Example for Bilateria</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Upcoming features: </p>
<ul>
<li>Right now, you can only delete taxa via a specific url (davetaxonomy.herokuapp.com/remove/&lt;nameOfTaxon&gt;). Eventually I’ll make this part of the UI.</li>
<li>While synapomorphies are entered as part of the taxon creation process, they’re never actually displayed after this. I’ll change that. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Ecology-Simulation"><a href="#Ecology-Simulation" class="headerlink" title="Ecology Simulation"></a>Ecology Simulation</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/Newms34/lifeStuff" target="_blank" rel="external">Link</a></p>
<p>This one is, so far, the most complex. It’s basically a food web/ecology simulation, in which there are a number of organisms with specific ‘diets’. The simulation follows these rules: </p>
<ul>
<li>Except for plants, which operate by their own rules (they’re hipsters like that), all organisms have a specific list of organisms that they like to eat. </li>
<li>Organisms constantly lose health, and replenish this whenever they feed. This acts a starvation mechanic.</li>
<li><p>Interactions between organisms fall into a number of categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predation: a predator organism ‘tags’ a prey organism, and attempts to feed on it. If successful, the predator organism gains health.</li>
<li>Intraspecific competition: Usually does not result in death, but may result in one of the organisms being injured (i.e., losing health).</li>
<li>Interspecific, non-predatory competition: this can result in the death of one of the two organisms. However, it does not ever result in one of the organisms gaining health.</li>
<li>Mating: a male and female of the same species have a good time together.</li>
<li>Nothing: Finally, if two organisms have no particular interaction set between them (i.e., a wolf and a tree), then nothing happens: the two just go about their business</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both mating and predation have a certain chance of success. Mating success simply determines whether an offspring is produced or not. Predation, if successful, kills the prey organism and heals the predator. If unsuccessful, the predator takes damage.</li>
<li>To prevent ‘sticking’ (i.e., predator A continuously following prey item B until it makes a successful kill), organisms have a cooldown timer on things like predation and mating. While this actually isn’t as important for predation, as the predator might equally well end up killing itself, this is quite important for mating, where two ‘stuck together’ organism may continously mate, leading to intense overpopulation.</li>
<li>newborn organisms have a slightly increased chance of winning predation event if they are the prey item. </li>
<li>organisms have a few timers:<ul>
<li>a starvation timer. As mentioned above. This prevents organisms from just sitting there and doing nothing.</li>
<li>a maturity timer. Basically, newborn organisms must wait a certain amount of time (dependent on species) before they themselves can mate.</li>
<li>a gestation timer. This actually doesn’t determine how long after mating before a newborn is produced. This happens immediately. Instead, this misnamed timer acts as a time-between matings deally, preventing organisms from mating too many times. This is also based on real-world species-specific data</li>
<li>a predation timer. Prevents an organism from eating too often</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The decision on what an organism is doing (i.e., is it just wandering, seeking prey, or seeking a mate) is determined by how recently each of the relevant events occured.</li>
<li>Finally, the organisms, if not actively interacting, attempt to stay within a certain distance from each other as part of an underlying flocking simulation. A simplified version of this flocking sim can be seen by clicking the [Old Version] button. </li>
</ul>
<p>Setup basically just consists of setting the number of organisms. Click each organism to see what eats. Note that the dragon basically acts as an apex predator, and its particular timers are based on estimates of Tyrannosaur data. </p>
<p>Finally, please note that the simulation is still buggy, and you may find that organisms tend to fall off the screen more often than not. </p>

        <h2 id="Opposing-Forces"><a href="#Opposing-Forces" class="headerlink" title="Opposing Forces"></a>Opposing Forces</h2><p>I’ve been thinking a bit about the teaching of programming. Like any technically intense subject, there’s a necessary balance between two (somewhat) opposing forces. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dumping<sup>1</sup> as much information as possible on the students, so that they can successfully navigate the labyrinthe that is whatever topic you’re trying to teach them.</li>
<li>Actually effectively teaching them anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>The important point here is that, while you can get a bunch of students to memorize a bunch code snippets, the difference between <code>call()</code> and <code>apply()</code> and <code>bind()</code>, or all of the standard methods on the <code>String</code> prototype<sup>2</sup>, this does NOT constitute teaching. In this post, I’m gonna examine the ways in which we can first ineffectively and then (hopefully!) effectively hit both marks.</p>
<h2 id="How-Not-To-Do-It"><a href="#How-Not-To-Do-It" class="headerlink" title="How Not To Do It"></a>How Not To Do It</h2><h3 id="A-K-A-the-Look-At-What-I-Can-Do-method"><a href="#A-K-A-the-Look-At-What-I-Can-Do-method" class="headerlink" title="A.K.A., the Look At What I Can Do method"></a>A.K.A., the <em>Look At What I Can Do</em> method</h3><p>There’s an old, famous adage in teaching: <em>Show, don’t tell</em>. Basically, teachers shouldn’t just tell students that an idea is true, but rather demonstrate it. Obviously, there are limits to this. For example, all of euclidean geometry is based off of the unprovable assumption that, simply put, a point is a point, a line is a line, and a plane is a plane<sup>3</sup>. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of ineffective teaching stems from the assumption that because you tell students something, they’ll learn it. I could go into a completely separate tangent about Howard Gardener’s multiple intelligences, and how verbal learning is only one of at least seven separate styles, but suffice it to say that this is almost never an effective pedagogical method.</p>
<p>What’s worse, this lack of absorption is often compounded by severe information overload. Here’s an example: </p>
<ol>
<li>You’re teaching JavaScript, and you have a class of completely beginner programmers. They know how2computer, but they’ve never touched code in their lives.</li>
<li>You show them the following script:<br><pre><br>var myName = ‘Dave’;<br>myName = prompt(‘Enter a name please.’);<br>function sayHi(n){<br>alert(‘Hello ‘+n+’!’);<br>}<br>sayHi(myName);<br></pre><br><small>Fig 1: A “simple” code example</small></li>
</ol>
<p>Simple, right? It just asks for their name and then says hello! Great way to introduce a simple bit of JavaScript, right?</p>
<p><em>Wrong!</em> Remember, you’re (most likely) looking at this from the perspective of a relatively seasoned programmer. You know what we mean when we have a word followed by parentheses (i.e., <code>myFunction(thing)</code>). You know what variables are. So you look at this example and automatically know what it does. But imagine someone who’s never seen a programming function, or worse, has yet to go through high-school algebra (i.e., does not know what a variable is). For that person, the concept of changing variables<sup>4</sup> may be still foreign to them. </p>
<p>This is an example (albeit a comparatively simple one) of a case of telling and not showing. In this case, our hypothetical teacher (you) assumes that because you already have the knowledge, it’ll be easy for your students to learn. The teacher fails to make the cognitive prediction between amount of knowledge that the students need to gain before they’re competent and the cognitive “leaps” that they can effectively take to get to that knowledge</p>
<p>Worse still, the student may not realized that they haven’t learned the material effectively until too late (i.e., the exam, or when they need to use this knowledge in a real-world scenario). This stems from the copy-and-paste programming education that this “tell” style of teaching lends itself to. Imagine that you’re a student in the above class. You’re told to copy and paste the above code, but you can (for now) change whatever’s between the quotes. You write: </p>
<p><pre><br>var myName = ‘Bob’;<br>myName = prompt(‘Who are you?!’);<br>function sayHi(n){<br>    alert(‘Greetings, ‘+n+’!’);<br>}<br>sayHi(myName);<br></pre><br><small>Fig 2: The student writes some code</small></p>
<p>So you run your code, and hey, it works! It says something different now, so that must mean you know what you’re doing. Right? </p>
<p>Well, no. It means you’ve copied some code directly. While this is fine later on (hello, <a href="stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>), this doesn’t teach you anything except how to type. Your teacher introduced at least 7 different concepts here<sup>5</sup>. Because these are relatively fundamental concepts, your teacher assumed that they’d be basal enough that anyone would either know them, or immediately “get” them.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to ask what the most fundamental pieces of these scripts are, and how we can break them down into (still functioning!) pieces that teach only a few concepts at a time.</p>
<h2 id="The-Pillars-of-Programming"><a href="#The-Pillars-of-Programming" class="headerlink" title="The Pillars of Programming"></a>The Pillars of Programming</h2><h3 id="A-K-A-What’s-Actually-Important"><a href="#A-K-A-What’s-Actually-Important" class="headerlink" title="A.K.A., What’s Actually Important"></a>A.K.A., What’s Actually Important</h3><p>So what are these fundamental pieces? Well, to answer that, perhaps we’d better start by asking what’s common to all (or at least, most) languages<sup>6</sup>. This’ll help us see what particular pieces we may wrongly assume everyone already knows. Here’s my list (feel free to skip this section if you want):</p>
<h4 id="Variables-var-myVar-39-chocolate-39"><a href="#Variables-var-myVar-39-chocolate-39" class="headerlink" title="Variables: var myVar = &#39;chocolate&#39;"></a>Variables: <code>var myVar = &#39;chocolate&#39;</code></h4><p>In order to store information, your program needs little boxes in which to store that stuff. Just like you might label a box in your closet “shoes”, or a drawer “silverware”, we might label a ‘box’ in our code as <code>myVar</code>. We could then store in this box your favorite flavor of ice cream. In some languages, different variables can store different kinds of information. Your cardboard shoebox can store shoes, but you’d probably not wanna store last night’s chicken stew in there. </p>
<h4 id="Arrays-Lists-var-simpsons-39-Lisa-39-39-Bart-39-39-Maggie-39-39-Marge-39-39-Homer-39"><a href="#Arrays-Lists-var-simpsons-39-Lisa-39-39-Bart-39-39-Maggie-39-39-Marge-39-39-Homer-39" class="headerlink" title="Arrays/Lists: var simpsons = [&#39;Lisa&#39;,&#39;Bart&#39;,&#39;Maggie&#39;,&#39;Marge&#39;,&#39;Homer&#39;]"></a>Arrays/Lists: <code>var simpsons = [&#39;Lisa&#39;,&#39;Bart&#39;,&#39;Maggie&#39;,&#39;Marge&#39;,&#39;Homer&#39;]</code></h4><p>Remember how we said different variables can store different stuff? Well, some variables are designed to hold multiple bits of information. In the example above, the variable <code>simpsons</code> stores all of the (human) members of the Simpsons’ family. Just a useful way of organizing information!</p>
<h4 id="Conditionals-if-condition-then-actionIfTrue-else-actionIfFalse"><a href="#Conditionals-if-condition-then-actionIfTrue-else-actionIfFalse" class="headerlink" title="Conditionals: if(condition) then actionIfTrue else actionIfFalse"></a>Conditionals: <code>if(condition) then actionIfTrue else actionIfFalse</code></h4><p>Programs are famous for making complex decisions. It was, generally, why the first programs are written. <em>Conditionals</em> allow a program to interpret different input and change depending on what that input says. For example, let’s say you write code for a robot to sort your house out. It inspects each container in your house and then puts the appropriate item in there. You might have something like the following</p>
<p><pre><br>if (box_for_shoes==true) then<br>    Put_Shoes_In<br>else if (box_for_tupperware==true) then<br>    Put_Stew_In<br>else<br>    Yell “I don’t know what to do!”<br>end<br></pre><br><small>Fig 3: Example of a conditional</small><sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Your robot inspects the box, and first asks “Is it a shoebox?”. If yes, it sticks shoes in there. If no, it then asks if the container is tupperware. If so, it sticks stew in there. Finally, if neither of these is true, it screams at you in frustration. </p>
<h4 id="Loops-while-thing-is-true-then-do-something"><a href="#Loops-while-thing-is-true-then-do-something" class="headerlink" title="Loops: while (thing is true) then do something"></a>Loops: <code>while (thing is true) then do something</code></h4><p>Imagine your house-sorting robot needs to sort 1000 boxes (you really need to do something about your boxes, dude). You <em>could</em> write the above conditional 1000 times. Or, you could not drive yourself completely insane, and use a loop! Note that, for the example below, we’re pretending that “<code>sort_a_box</code>“ just tells the robot to, well, sort that box.</p>
<p><pre><br>var num_boxes = 1000<br>while (num_boxes&gt;0) do<br>    sort_a_box<br>    num_boxes = num_boxes - 1<br>end<br></pre><br><small>Fig 4: Example of a <code>while()</code> loop</small></p>
<p>So we start out with 1000 boxes. Then we have a loop, where each time it asks “Is the number of boxes greater than zero?” If so, it continues. Otherwise, it stops. Finally, we subtract 1 from the number of boxes, so that our robot essentially ticks one box off as being ‘done’ each time. Note that there’s no “false” condition for this loop: there’s no <code>while (thing is true) then do_something otherwise do_other_thing</code></p>
<p>Another incredibly useful type of loop is the <code>for</code> loop. This loop basically runs a set number of times. So if you wanted to say “Hi!” 10 times, you could do:</p>
<p><pre><br> say “Hi!”<br> say “Hi!”<br> say “Hi!”<br> say “Hi!”<br> say “Hi!”<br> say “Hi!”<br> say “Hi!”<br> say “Hi!”<br> say “Hi!”<br> say “Hi!”<br></pre><br><small>Fig 5: Code repetition</small></p>
<p>Pretty repetitive, right? Alternatively, you could do the following:</p>
<p><pre><br> var i = 0;<br> for i,i&lt;10,i+=1 do<br>     say “Hi!”<br> end</pre></p>
<p><br><small>Fig 6: <code>for()</code> Loop</small></p>
<p>So much more compact! This loop tells us to start by making a variable named <code>i</code>, and setting it to zero. We then start our loop. During each iteration of the loop, we look at <code>i</code> and ask whether it’s still less than 10. If it is, we increment <code>i</code> by one and do another iteration. Otherwise, we stop.</p>
<h4 id="Functions-Methods-function-myFunc-name-do-say-quot-Hello-quot-name-endFunc"><a href="#Functions-Methods-function-myFunc-name-do-say-quot-Hello-quot-name-endFunc" class="headerlink" title="Functions/Methods: function myFunc(name) do say &quot;Hello, &quot;+name endFunc"></a>Functions/Methods: <code>function myFunc(name) do say &quot;Hello, &quot;+name endFunc</code></h4><p>Loops are pretty great at making our code more efficient, but what if we have bigger blocks of code that we wanna pass around? Or, worse, what if we don’t know the order in which we want our code to run? This is where functions (also known as <em>methods</em> in some areas) come in. Functions allow us to write blocks of reusable code that we can pass around for different areas of the code to “borrow”.<br>Let’s stick our conditional example from above in a function</p>
<p><pre><br>function shoe_or_stew(box_for_shoes,box_for_tupperware) do<br>    if (box_for_shoes==true) then<br>        Put_Shoes_In<br>    else if (box_for_tupperware==true) then<br>        Put_Stew_In<br>    else<br>        Yell “I don’t know what to do!”<br>end<br></pre><br><small>Fig 7: My First Function</small></p>
<p>The bits between the parentheses are called <em>arguments</em>. They basically allow us to pass in information for our function for each ‘run’ of that function. So each time our robot gets a new box, it runs this function. If the value passed in for <code>box_for_shoes</code> is <em>true</em>, then it’s a shoebox. If the value for <code>box_for_tupperware</code> is <em>true</em>, it’s a tupperware container. And if neither is true, yell in frustration. </p>
<h4 id="Blocks-do-some-stuff-end"><a href="#Blocks-do-some-stuff-end" class="headerlink" title="Blocks: do some_stuff end"></a>Blocks: <code>do some_stuff end</code></h4><p>You may have noticed in the past few examples the words <code>do</code> and <code>end</code>. These sit on the ends of sometjing in programming called a <em>block</em>. Wikipedia defines a “code block [as] a section of code which is grouped together” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_%28programming%29" target="_blank" rel="external">Wikipedia:Block Programming</a>). We can then do things with those blocks, like use them as the result of a conditional, or the contents of a function.<br>In some languages, the blocks are denoted by curly brackets (<code>{</code> and <code>}</code>).</p>

        <h1 id="Why-Program"><a href="#Why-Program" class="headerlink" title="Why Program?"></a>Why Program?</h1><h2 id="Of-Screens-and-Stereotypes"><a href="#Of-Screens-and-Stereotypes" class="headerlink" title="Of Screens and Stereotypes"></a>Of Screens and Stereotypes</h2><p>Why be a programmer? Well, before I answer that question, perhaps we should look at why that even is a question. Why do we still need to justify our decisions to sit behind computer screens, presumably wear pocket protectors and thick-rimmed glasses, and speak in nasally voices? Because let’s face it: that’s exactly what the stereotype of ‘the programmer’ has been for decades. My answer to that question is a multiple part one, and it begins with my love of building things back when I was but a wee lad.</p>
<h2 id="The-History-of-Dave"><a href="#The-History-of-Dave" class="headerlink" title="The History of Dave"></a>The History of Dave</h2><p>I have had many what one might ostensibly call ‘career ideas’ in my school career, but what they’ve all centered around is the desire to construct and to present information to others.<br>As I’ve mentioned, my school career is diverse. In 2009, I graduated from Lafayette college with a degree in biology, which any scientist will tell you has about as little to do with programming (or indeed, math in general) as anything that’s still in the field of ‘science’ possibly could do. Biologists love dealing in fuzzy logic (or fuzzy creatures), and the only math the traditional biologist is ‘comfortable’ with is the relatively tame world of statistics. I mention this because it’ll help me explain later why I translated into programming eventually. I wasn’t the traditional biologist, and I would often observe particular pieces of the natural world – the structure of DNA and its relation to RNA, protein, and even binary code; the ecological interaction of different levels of a trophic web, and the ‘self balancing’ nature of a mature ecosystem, for example. So it was only natural that I started to apply myself to some basic coding techniques to try to emulate these systems. I learned JavaScript, and dug up my old memories of HTML and CSS (I’d pretty much stopped learning anything web-related back when the font tag was still in vogue!).</p>
<h2 id="Teaching"><a href="#Teaching" class="headerlink" title="Teaching"></a>Teaching</h2><p>Meanwhile, in my non-computer-related life, I took up the pursuit of teaching. I studied at Drexel University, graduating in 2011 with a Masters’ degree in science education at a secondary level. Again, dear reader, you may be wondering “Dave, what the heck? You were just talking about biology vs. programming, and now you’re onto teaching? Get your mind on track!”. But bear with me. My love of understanding how to model natural systems, how to build, and, let’s just face it, programming in general, extended to the world of teaching. It was all very well and good if I could build a website to translate DNA to RNA and protein, but unless the site could explain why this translation worked, it was useless. Paradoxically, this meant designing a program that could both explain the biological, chemical-related world of transcription and translation – mRNA, tRNA, codons, and all those good buzzwords high schoolers hate – and the oft more strict world of programming. Here’s a brief example:<br>1.DNA is a chemical code comprised of differing combinations of A (Adenine), T (Thymine), C (Cytosine), and G (Guanine).<br>2.Its counterpart RNA (the mid-step to conversion into a protein) basically copies that code (think of DNA as the master blueprint, and RNA as the copy of the blueprint taken to the job site).<br>3.But wait, there’s more! Unlike DNA, RNA has no “T” (that’s thymine, folks). Instead, it uses Uracil (U).<br>4.So in a very simple programming exercise, I needed to replace every instance of ‘T’ in the input string with ‘U’.</p>
<h2 id="So-What"><a href="#So-What" class="headerlink" title="So What?"></a>So What?</h2><p>So in short, I guess what made me want to program was both a love of web design (and hey, let’s face it, the ‘tricks’ you can do with it’) as well as a desire to take advantage of yet another medium to help in the education of science.</p>
<h2 id="Another-Observation"><a href="#Another-Observation" class="headerlink" title="Another Observation"></a>Another Observation</h2><p>Perhaps not directly related to the question itself, but here’s a bit of an interesting observation: DNA is a full-fledged programming language, in the same way any other programming language is. It’s reactive, in that the ‘programs’ it generates are reactive to their environment (we call these programs “living things”). It is moderately self-correcting, containing error-proofing mechanisms that any programmer should be jealous of. The major two differences stylistically between DNA and, say, JavaScript are:</p>
<p>DNA is based on a quaternary (four-part) code, while computer programming languages are at some level influencing a binary system.<br>Its development cycle is a bit slow, on the order of centuries, millennia, or eons. Waiting for the next program update to come out is not advised.</p>
